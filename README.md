# Titanic Survivability Classifier with Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Overview

This project applies tree-based machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of Titanic passengers using a structured dataset. The focus is on implementing and comparing two models:
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests (via Bagging)**

## Objectives

- Implement a decision tree classifier using Information Gain.
- Extend the tree-based method to a Random Forest using bagging.
- Evaluate model accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.
- Understand recursive splitting, tree depth control, and ensemble voting.

## Dataset

The dataset contains features of Titanic passengers (e.g., age, class, gender) along with their survival label.

## Tasks

- Preprocess and clean the dataset.
- Implement entropy, conditional entropy, and information gain functions.
- Build a recursive decision tree classifier from scratch.
- Implement a Random Forest using bagging over multiple decision trees.
- Compare performance across models using metrics such as accuracy and depth.
